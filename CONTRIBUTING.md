# Contributing

Contributions welcome.

Implementation notes are at [IMPLEMENTATION.md](implementation.md). 
If you're unsure about anything, feel free to ask.

Just submit a PR for small changes (bugfixes, typos, etc...). Comment first on existing 
issues if you're going to work on something to avoid duplication of effort.

Submit an issue for new features before submitting a PR.
